Darwin's Playground is an arcade-style RTS game, inspired by the mechanics of other games
such as Sid Meier's Civilization, Plague Inc., Spore, and Settlers of Catan.

In this game, you create and evolve a species over time to make them grow and survive in their environment. As the species' populatioon grows, it's population will spread throughout the surrounding regions as well. You must continue to balance the species' traits and evolutionary status so that it may survive and thrive as it spreads and becomes dominant over the land.
